The file data_1000.txt.tar.gz is a tar file containing the experimental data used in the study "Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass".

The file may be extracted using the command "tar -xvf data_1000.txt.tar.gz". This should result into a single ASCI file data_1000.txt (roughly 153.5 MB in size).

The file contains five columns. First and second columns represent the positions (x and y-coordinates) of the colloidal particles in pixels. A factor of (1158/1392)*1e-6 should be multiplied to convert the coordinates from pixel to micron. Third column represents the time at which the coordinates are recorded. Fourth
